Hi, I'm **Agathe**!

I'm a junior **web developper**!

My main tools are Ruby :gem: - Ruby on Rails - Javascript(ES6) - HTML5/Bootstrap/CSS - SQL/PostgreSQL

I'm currently working on a fun (and sexy!) project: [Vibrary](https://www.vibrary.fr/) (Check the [repo](https://github.com/clementlemoigne/vibrary))

=> Meet my amazing teammates! [Maner](https://github.com/manerschnetzlon), [Dorian](https://github.com/DorianGC-G) and [Cl√©ment](https://github.com/clementlemoigne)


I look forward to working with you ;)
